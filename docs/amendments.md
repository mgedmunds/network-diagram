# Amendment log

Add items here during app review. Claude reads this at session start and works
through the "Ready to action" list. Plain English, no special format needed.

**Conventions:**
- Each item is timestamped when requested and when completed.
- Completed items are removed from the list once the fix is committed; the completion
  date is recorded in the git commit message for traceability.
- Items are deleted from this file once done — use `git log` to see what was fixed and when.

## Ready to action

*(empty — batch of 15 amendments completed 2026-06-20; see git log on branch amendments-batch-1)*

## Parked (needs decision or not urgent)

- [ ] UI: node selector resets to blank whenever the view or filters change. Could instead preserve the selection if the same node ID exists in the new view. Needs a decision on whether this is the desired behaviour. Reassess once the move-to-sidebar item is done. *(requested: 2026-06-19)*

- [ ] Docs: docs/erd.svg is no longer auto-generated (DiagrammeR removed). If the schema changes, it must be updated manually or regenerated via a separate script. Low priority until schema is finalised. *(requested: 2026-06-18)*

- [ ] Candidate network — visit timing risk ranking: develop a ranking system for candidate transmission pairs based on timing and nature of shared context visits (infectious period overlap, exposure window, proximity of visit dates). Use this to tier or filter the candidate network list. Significant design work needed before implementation. *(requested: 2026-06-19)*
